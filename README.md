## Installation
  Please make sure that you install the packageds required using "npm i" or "npm install". In addition, prior to running the code, you will need to input your own password in the .env file, as I removed mine when uploading my code to github.

## Usage
  Once your installations are complete, using the Command Line please: 
  1) load the database using mysql,
  2) then load your seeds, using "npm run seed"
  3) and finally, you can the type in "npm start" to start the application. 
  
Once the server is up and running, you can then navigate to the server page using Insomnia (or your preferred server engine) to test the operations. If something is unsuccessful, you will receive an error.
